# Fedora Telegram Group Report Bot

To setup this project create a .env file from the example and place your actual
Bot API key inside of it.

The run.sh and systemd service assume the user "apache" exist and the files to
this bot are located in /var/www/html/fedora-tg-bot


### This is a super simple bot made by @wolfshappen on Telegram so dont expect Magic :P
